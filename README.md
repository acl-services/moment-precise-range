# Moment Precise Range plugin

This is a fork of the original moment-precise-range plugin for moment.js

There are modified date range relative time thresholds found in this library.

Include `readable-range.js` in your project.


## Developement

To run the tests, first install bower components, then open the spec runner.

    bower install
    open SpecRunner.html
